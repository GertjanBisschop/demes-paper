Demographic models of increasing complexity are being inferred and simulated,
yet there is no agreed upon data format for describing 
these models. We present the Demes specification, a data model and file format
definition which provides both a human-readable and machine-parsable
description of complex demographies, built on standard technologies. We provide
thoroughly tested software components using this specification, 
and demonstrate Demes support in several popular simulation and inference methods.
