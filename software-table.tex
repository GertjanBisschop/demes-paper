\texttt{demes-python} &
    A Python library for loading, saving, and working with
    Demes models. Includes conversion utilities for existing
    demographic model descriptions such as
    \texttt{ms}~\citep{hudson2002generating}
    (\url{https://github.com/popsim-consortium/demes-python}).\\

\texttt{demes-c} &
    A C library for parsing Demes YAML descriptions.
    (\url{https://github.com/grahamgower/demes-c}). \\

\texttt{demesdraw} &
    A Python library for visualising Demes models
    (\url{https://github.com/grahamgower/demesdraw}). \\
