\abstract{
Understanding the demographic history of populations is a
key goal in population genetics, and with improving methods
and data, ever more complex models are being estimated.
Demographic models of current interest (consisting of a set of discrete populations,
their sizes and growth rates, and continuous and pulse migrations
between those populations over a number of epochs) can require
dozens of parameters to fully describe. There is currently
no standard format to define such models, significantly
hampering  progress in the field. In particular, the important
task of translating the model descriptions in published
work into input suitable for population genetic simulators is labour intensive
and error prone.
We propose the Demes data model and file format,
built on widely used technologies,
to alleviate these issues. Demes provides a well-defined and unambigous
graphical model of populations and their properties that is straightforward to
implement in software, and a text file format that is designed for
simplicity and clarity.
We provide thoroughly tested implementations of Demes parsers in Python
and C, and showcase initial support in a number of simulators and inference
methods.

\section*{Introduction}

The ever-increasing amount of genetic sequencing data from genetically and
geographically diverse species and populations has allowed us to infer complex
demography and study life history at fine scales. An integral component to such
population genetics studies is simulation. Software to either simulate whole
genome sequences
\citep{thornton2014cpp,staab2015scrm,kelleher2016efficient,haller2019slim}
or informative summary statistics of diversity
\citep{gutenkunst2009inferring,kamm2017efficient,jouganous2017inferring} have
enabled the increasing complexity of genomic studies, with several software
packages capable of working with large sample sizes, many interacting populations, and
deviations from random-mating models of panmixia.
This ability to infer and simulate such complex demographic scenarios, however,
has highlighted a major shortcoming in community standards. The fragmented
landscape of different approaches to describing demographic models makes
it difficult to compare inferences made by different methods,
and to reliably simulate from previously inferred models.

Inference methods for demography usually output a set of
text files which describe the inferred model,
and nearly all methods use different file formats.
% Thus, any comparison
% between inferences requires these file formats to be parsed, with the user
% being left with the task of unifying the data models.
Inference results are typically reported in publications
via a combination of visual depiction,
a list of key parameters in tabular form and a discussion within the text.
Unfortunately there is often ambiguity in these descriptions and
implementing the precise model inferred for later simulation
is at best tedious and error prone~\citep{ragsdale2020lessons}
and occasionally impossible because of missing information.
The \stdpopsim\ project is a community-maintained catalog of species
information and demographic models designed to provide standardised
population genetic simulations~\citep{adrion2020community}.
The development process for adding demographic models to
\stdpopsim\ tries to avoid errors in model implementation by requiring two
independent implementations of each model
to be equivalent. While this process is
robust and has uncovered both significant
errors~\citep{ragsdale2020lessons} and ambiguities in
published models, it is labour intensive.
It would be far better if published results
were reported in an unambiguous standardised format that could be provided
directly as input to simulators.

Simulation is a core tool in population genetics, and a
large number of different methods have been developed
over the past three decades~\citep{carvajal2008simulation,liu2008survey,
arenas2012simulation,yuan2012overview,hoban2012computer}.
Simulations are based on highly idealised population models
and one of the key uses of inferred demographic histories
is to make simulations more realistic.
Simulation methods take three broad approches to specifying
the demographic model to simulate,
using either a command line
interface~\citep[e.g.][]{hudson2002generating,kern2016discoal},
a custom input file
format~\citep[e.g.][]{guillaume2006nemo,excoffier2011fastsimcoal,shlyakhter2014cosi2},
or an Application Programming Interface (API) to allow
models be defined programmatically~\citep[e.g.][]{
thornton2014cpp,kelleher2016efficient,becheler2019quetzal,haller2019slim}.
Command line interfaces are a concise way of expressing
demographic models, and the syntax defined by \ms~\citep{hudson2002generating}
is used by a number of different
simulators~\citep[e.g.][]{ewing2010msms,chen2009fast,staab2015scrm},
and the POPDemog visualisation method~\citep{zhou2018popdemog}.
However, this conciseness means that models of even intermediate complexity
are difficult for humans to understand, making errors highly likely.
Input parameter file formats for simulators allow the model specification
to be less terse and (potentially) also allow for documentation in the
form of comments. However, there is no standard format shared across
simulators, and the details of the demographic models are not separated
from other simulation parameters. The APIs use by individual simulators
to define demographic models are also not appropriate as an interchange
standard because of the dependency on both the programming language involved,
and the specific details of the simulator in question.

Here we present ``Demes'', a data model and file format
specification for complex demographic models developed by the PopSim
Consortium. The Demes data model precisely defines key parameters
of populations and their relationships over time in an extensible way,
and provides a way to explicitly encode all information relevant to
demography while avoiding repetition. This data model is implemented
in the widely used YAML format~\citep{ben2009yaml}, which provides a
good balance between human and machine readability.
The specification precisely
defines the required behaviour of implementations, ensuring that there
is no ambiguity of interpretation, and includes both a reference
implementation and an extensive suite of test examples and their expected
output. The initial software ecosystem includes high-quality
Python and C parser implementations, as well as utilities for verification
and visualisation of Demes models, and has been implemented in
several popular inference and simulation methods
(Table~\ref{tab-software}).
We hope that this
data model and file format will be widely adopted by the community,
such that users can expect to simulate directly from
inferred models with little or no programming effort.

\section*{Demes}

The Demes specification is a formal data model for describing
the properties of populations over time,
along with some metadata and provenance information.
The data model is based on the ubiquitous JSON~\citep{bray2017javascript}
standard, and the structure formally defined using
JSON Schema~\citep{wright2020json}.
The Demes JSON schema rigorously defines the data model,
specifying the hierarchical structure and the properties that are allowed in different
contexts along with their types and permissable ranges. This schema, and its
accompanying documentation, fully describe the entities in the model and their
relationships, and the required behaviour of implementations. Since the
schema is definitive, we will not recapitulate the details
here, but instead focus on the high level properties of the model and
the rationale behind key design decisions.

The design of Demes is a balance between two partially competing requirements:
that (a) models should be easy for humans to understand and manipulate; and (b)
software processing Demes models should be provided with an unambiguous
representation that is straightforward to process. For efficiency of
understanding and avoidance of model specification error, we require a data
representation without redundancy (i.e., repetition of values). But, for the
simplicity of software working with the Demes model (and the avoidance of
programming error, or divergence in interpretations of the specification) it is
preferable to have an explicit representation, in which all relevant values are
readily available. Thus, we consider three entities: the high-level, human
readable, model specification; the low-level, fully-qualified model
specification; and the parser, which is responsible for transforming the former
into the latter.

\subsection*{Population genetics model}

In Demes, demographic models consist of one or more interacting populations (or
``demes"; to avoid confusion with the name of the specification itself we will
use the term ``population'' in this discussion, in the understanding that the
terms are interchangeable for our purposes). Populations are defined as a
collection of exchangable individuals that exist a specified period of time,
following a well-defined set of rules regarding population sizes, mating
systems, etc. Ancestor/descendent relationships between populations can be
defined, as well as continuous or instantaneous migration between coexisting
populations.

Population and event times are written as units in the past, so that time zero
corresponds to the final generation or ``now'', and event times in the past are
values greater than zero with larger values for events that occur in the more
distant past. While a natural specification for time units is in generations,
other time units are allowed, such as years. In the case the the time units are
not given in generations, the generation time must also be specified so that
times can be converted into generations. In general, as time flows from the
past to the present, populations, epochs, and migration events should be
specified in their order of appearance, so that their times are in descending
order.

Models include one or more populations that have sizes greater than zero for
the duration of their existences, and population sizes are given as the number
of individuals. A population must exist for some duration of time greater than
zero, so that its start time must be larger than its end time. It may have one
or more ancestors, which are other populations that exist at the population's
start time. If one ancestor is specified, the first generation is constructed
by randomly sampling parents from the ancestral population to contribute to
offspring in the newly generated population. If more than one ancestor is
specified, the proportions of ancestry from each contributing population must
be provided, and those proportions must sum to one. In this case, parents are
chosen randomly from each ancestral population with probability given by those
proportions. If no ancestors are specified, the population is assumed to have
start time equal to infinity, as individuals are not assumed to spontaneously
spring into existence.

Within populations, population sizes and mating systems are specified within
epochs. Epochs are non-overlapping intervals that cover the entire existence
interval of the population. Each epoch specifies the population size over that
interval, which can be a constant value or function defined by start and end
sizes that must remain positive.  If an epoch has a start time of infinity, the
population size for that epoch must be constant. Epochs can also specify
parameters for nonrandom mating, such as selfing or cloning rates, which give
the probability that offspring are generated from one generation to the next by
self-fertilization or cloning of an indivual \textbf{need to precisely specify
once this is determined}.

Finally, individuals in a population may have parents from a different
population through migrations. These can be defined as continuous migration
rates over intervals that populations overlap in time or through instantaneous
(or pulse) migration events at a given time. Continuous migration rates are
defined as the probability that parents in the ``destination`` population are
chosen from the ``source`` population.  Migration rates are thus per-generation
and must be less than one. Furthermore, if more than one source population have
continuous migration into the same destination population, the sum of those
migration rates must also be less than one, as rates define probabilities. The
probability that parents come from the same population is just one minus the
some of incoming migration rates. On the other hand, pulse migration events
specify the instantaeous replacement of a given fraction of individuals in a
destination population by individuals with parents from a source population.
The fraction must be between zero and one, and if more than one source
population has a pulse migration event to the same destination population and
the same time, those replacement events are applied sequentially in the order
that they are specified in the model.

\subsection*{High-level model specification}

The high-level description of Demes models is focused on the efficiency of
human understanding and the avoidance of errors. We have adopted the widely
used YAML format~\citep{ben2009yaml} as the recommended means of interchanging
Demes models (see Figure~\ref{fig-example} for examples). YAML is a data
serialisation language with an emphasis on simplicity, and interoperates well
with JSON (indeed, YAML 1.2 is a superset of JSON). We chose YAML over JSON
because although JSON is an excellent format for data interchange, it is
ill-suited for human understanding or manipulation. We also considered other
declarative data exchange formats such as TOML,
but chose YAML because of equivalance with JSON,
its popularity and good software support.
Since the Demes data model is defined in JSON Schema,
however, there is no formal dependency on YAML and implementations may choose
to use JSON directly if they wish (e.g., for greater efficiency).

Structurally, the high-level Demes specification encourages human understanding
by avoiding redundancy in the description where possible, and
by providing a mechanism for specifying default values that
are inherited hierarchically. Figure~\ref{fig-example} shows an example
Demes model expressed in both the high and low-level forms (both in
terms of YAML syntax).

\jkcomment{Finish up this section with a discussion of how we (a)
use default values defined in JSON schema; (b) define more
subtle implicit values in the specification itself; and (c) use the
defaults sections, all explified by Fig 1.}

\subsection*{Parsers}
The implicit value inference and default value propagation required to
fully resolve the high-level Demes model description is straightforward
to describe, but still requires significant effort to implement in
software. Moreover, there are many constraints on the data model
(for example, epoch \texttt{end\_time} values should be strictly increasing
within a deme), which must be enforced.
It would not be reasonable to require every program that
takes Demes models as input to implement this logic, as the programming
effort would be significant (limiting adoption)
and it is likely that if there were many implementations some would differ
in their details (harming the software ecosystem). We therefore define
a standard software entity as part of the specification (the parser),
which performs this task, and which can be shared by programs that
support demes as an input. By having relatively few (ideally, one
per programming language), high-quality Demes parsers available as
libraries the probability of divergences from the standard is
greatly reduced.

The Demes specification precisely defines the required behaviour of
parsers, and we also provide a reference implementation written
in Python to resolve any potential ambiguities and to provide a
helpful template for other implementations. We also provide an
extensive suite suite of examples and the expected outputs. In addition,
we have high-quality parser implementations in the Python and C
languages (published under liberal open source licences),
providing a solid foundation for the software ecosystem.


\subsection*{Unambiguous low-level representation}

\jkcomment{Not sure if there's much point in this as a separate section any
more? This could really be said in the previous section.}

Parsers output the low-level description of Demes models,
which is an explicit representation
of the model where all parameters have been assigned values, and
all data constraints have been checked. The output is formally defined
as JSON, but in practise parsers output an object model that
is suitable for the particular programming language, and
that can be used directly by the implementing program.


\subsection*{Scope of the specification}
\jkcomment{This section is very rough.}

% https://github.com/popsim-consortium/demes-paper/issues/3

The Demes specification is by design simple and static---we wish to
unambiguously describe a demographic model with fully specified
and fixed parameters. This simplicity means that we cannot directly
specify distributions or estimated confidence intervals
for those parameters. While it is not difficult to imagine extending
the specification in ways that would allows us to do this, it would
greatly increase the complexity of parsers and would likely be of
little practical use in any case. This is because the parameters of
demographic models are typically tightly coupled, and cases in which
distributions for different parameters can be simply described are rare.
In this situation, the simplest way to describe estimated
distribution is simply to list a large number of samples from
the posterior. While writing out a large number of Demes models in
YAML format may seem inefficient, it can in fact be a compact
way to describe these distributions.
\jkcomment{TODO: add in a quick example here where we take an IM model
and simulate a posterior distribution under some reasonable model. Report
how much space it takes to represent a large number of samples from this
distribution}

Similarly, one might be interested in running simulations in which
the demographic model parameters are drawn from a distribution, e.g.,
in ABC inference~\citep{beaumont2002approximate}. Allowing for
the many distributions of interest would greatly increase the complexity of
parsers, with a relatively limited benefit. It would be far simpler
and more powerful to write some code to sample directly from the
distributions of interest, using, for example the Demes Python
API.
\jkcomment{This is garbled, but we get the point? You're probably never
going to be doing ABC from a completely general Demes model as input.
There will be some basic model that you have in mind, that you're generating
distributions of parameters around. So, what's the point in writing
general machinery to do this sampling, when you could write it yourself in
10 lines of Python?}
\jkcomment{Key point: if there was a concise way of writing down the joint
distribution of all the parameters, we wouldn't be doing simulations in the
first place.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Why we've avoided turning this into a model of everything, allowing
    for the specification of genome properties like recombination rates,
    etc.

    \item Why we've versioned the specification, and how we've planned
    for future extensions.

\section*{Discussion}

The difficulty of describing complex demographic models
for population genetic simulations has long been acknowledged
~\citep[][e.g.]{antao2007modeler4simcoal2}, % jk - any older refs for this?
and a number of different methods have been proposed to
make such simulations more accessible and less error prone.
Several Graphical User Interface (GUI) and visualisation
methods have been developed, which greatly facilitate
interpretation~\citep{mailund2005coasim,antao2007modeler4simcoal2,
ewing2010msms,zhou2018popdemog}. However, these methods
currently have little traction as they are all either directly coupled
to an internal simulation method or to the specific syntax
of a given simulator. Another approach that has been taken to
simplify running such simulations is to provide an API in a
scripting language such as Python or R, providing a flexible
interface either to a built-in simulation
engine~\citep{thornton2014cpp,kelleher2016efficient,haller2017flexible}
% jk: are/were there other simulation frontends out there?
or as a frontend for other simulators~\citep{staab2016coala}.
While APIs have many advantages and have grown in popularity in
recent years, the demographic model descriptions are tied
to the details of both the underlying simulation engines
and the programming language in question.

Stable and healthy software ecosystems require standard interchange
formats, allowing for the development of high-quality and long-lasting
tools that produce and consume the standard.
Demographic models are a key part of population genetics research,
and to date the transfer of inferred models to downstream simulations
has been ad-hoc, and conversions between the many different ways
of expressing such models is both labour intensive and fraught with errors.
The proposed Demes standard is an attempt to bridge this gap
between inference and simulation, and also to provide the foundations
for a sustainable ecosystem of tools built around this data model.
Table~\ref{tab-software} shows some initial infrastructure that we have
built as part of developing Demes, but many other useful tools
can be envisaged that either produce or consume this format.

Reproducibility is a significant problem throughout the
sciences~\citep{baker20161} and various measures have been
proposed to increase the likelihood of researchers being
able to replicate results in the
literature~\citep{munafo2017manifesto}. The most basic requirement
for reproducibility is that we must be able to state precisely what
the result in question is. The lack of standardisation in how
complex demographic models are communicated today, and the lack of
precision in the published model descriptions means that it is difficult
to replicate analyses, or reproduce those models for later simulation.
Thus, we hope that the Demes standard introduced here will be widely adopted
by inference methods and the results reported in publications
routinely included as supplemental material or uploaded to a data
repository in Demes format.
